              I'm now pursuing a Software Engineer Degree from Brigham Young University Idaho online and True Coders located in Birmingham, Alabama.
               I obtain the knowledge that will improve a company through my hard work and dedication. 
               Since starting the process, I have learned several coding languages.
                  <strong><br>Current skills: C#, MySQL, Dapper, HTML, CSS, Git, & JavaScript.</strong>
                    Presently, I'm a certified Ophthalmic Assistant and Optician. 
                    I use my ophthalmic skills to help vision-impaired patients and guide them with the correct information to take care of their eyes.
                    I have seven years of Ophthalmic medical assistant experience. 
                    I trained legally blind patients to insert contacts and remove them.
                      In my current career field, I have worked with the best ophthalmologist and optometrist assisting with patient care.
